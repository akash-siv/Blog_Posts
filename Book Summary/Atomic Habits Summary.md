### Routine

A thing that is practiced daily; it is an automatic response to a specific situation.

Cue-Craving-Response-Reward model

This is the four stages of habit.

*   **Cue** - initiates a behavior. (e.g., notification on mobile)
*   **Craving** - This is the motivation to do the response.
*   **Response** - This is the habit to do.
*   **Reward** - Reward is the gratification to the response.

If the habit doesn't satisfy all four aspects, it will not last long.

*   Always slightly improve the work you do on a daily basis.
*   Outputs of Habits are Exponential; you won't notice the outcome until you reach a certain threshold.
*   It's better to solve the cause of the problem instead of solving the problem.

*   Always align the habit to your identity. Instead of saying "I should read a book," say "I am a reader." Be the identity yourself. The more deeply a habit is aligned to your identity, the more difficult it is to change.
*   When and where are one of the important cues of habit creation. Eg: brush your teeth when you enter the bathroom, you sleep when you lie on the bed. Be specific on the habit you want to do, when, why, and how to do it.
*   Always create a new habit before or after an existing habit.
*   Habits are easy to stick when it is aligned with your genetics. Choose the habit that best suits you. Your gene plays a major role in building the right habit.
*   Goldilocks rule: Perform a task at the right amount of difficulty. If you know the task is too hard, then you will not gonna practice it.

*   If the task is too easy, you will be bored of completing it. With the right amount of difficulty, you are focused, motivated, and concentrated on the task.
*   Boredom is the greatest enemy of the habit. If you broke the boredom of habit, then you are likely to stick to it.
*   The downside of habits is, you do things in a certain way; you are not improving them.
*   The upside of habit is, you can do things immediately; it takes less time to take actions.
*   Always reflect and review your habits.
