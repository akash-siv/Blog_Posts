summary: A lifelong learner’s attempt to document, share, and reflect.

I have been a curious individual since my childhood, always eager to explore how things work. Science and electronics have fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I’m the person who constantly pops up with a stream of questions — some silly, some important — all driven by an intense desire to understand the world around me.

Over the years, I’ve cultivated a wide range of hobbies: designing home automation systems, PCB design, 3D modeling, coding and app development, gardening, trading and investing, learning human anatomy, setting up home lab, and even making music. My list keeps expanding as my passion for learning and solving complex problems grows.

I love diving deep into these activities and find immense gratification not just in doing them, but also in helping others through them. However, I realized one hard truth — **time is limited**. Enjoying my work at a thoughtful pace gave me fulfillment, but managing multiple hobbies meant I needed to spend my time more deliberately.

One major step I took was **eliminating distractions**. I stepped away from social media completely because it offered little real value to my goals. Instead, I started blocking time for important tasks and documenting everything meticulously with pen and paper. Writing down my thoughts helped me stay organized and cut through the noise.

During this journey, I drew wisdom from timeless works like *The Art of War*, *Thirukural*, *Bhagavad Gita*, and *The Book of Five Rings*. These books gave me not just strategies for life, but a deeper understanding of myself. Learning from the experiences of great thinkers profoundly shaped my mindset.

Then a thought struck me — **What if I die today?**  
How will the world remember me?  
What would happen to all the notes, thoughts, and experiences I’ve gathered?

My handwritten notes kept piling up, making them harder to manage. That’s when I came up with a solution: **digitize everything**. By converting my notes into markdown format, I could make them easily searchable, better organized, and simple to share with others.

Thus, this blogging idea was born.

Using a framework called **Hugo**, which transforms markdown files into HTML pages, and hosting it on my own server, I created a space to **organize my learnings** and **share my knowledge** with the world. Writing here also follows the philosophy of Richard Feynman — that teaching others reveals the gaps in our understanding and deepens our memory.

In short, this blog serves two purposes:
- **To showcase and share** my journey of exploration, creativity, and learning.
- **To organize and internalize** my knowledge more effectively.

In the future blog I will explain more about how I setup my own blog and its pipeline.
Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope something here inspires you, sparks your curiosity, or helps you find answers to your own questions — just like I have spent my life trying to do.
